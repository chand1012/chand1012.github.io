title: Python For Programmers Part 2
---

# What?

This is a series on Python and how to correctly use Python when coming from a background in another computer language. Because of this, this will not be a slow intro into programming and it will be assumed you have a preferred text editor and are smart enough to get Python running. You can download installers and packages from their official website found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Basic knowledge of how to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and how to operate a computer is also preferred.

This series will assume you are familiar with some form of a computer language and basic programming paradigms. C/C++, JavaScript, and Go will be referred to most as they are my most familiar languages other than Python, but anyone with experience in really anything else should be able to follow along.

# One More Data Type

There is something I omitted from the last article that you experienced object-oriented programmers and hackers would probably be in anguish without: classes. Classes are very engrained in Python's nature. To create your own class, it can be done like so.
