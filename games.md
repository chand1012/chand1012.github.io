This is a page with a few of the games I've made. For the games made with Pico-8, the controls are the arrow keys and the Z and X keys.

# Pico Wars

I was a big fan of [JonTron](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJdEguB1F1CiYe7OEi3SBg)'s [StarCade](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmsahz1j_BDKaOffHm33ghV5_9AwV_Q6S) series, and after watching the series, I took inspiration from the notoriously bad and short [Death Star Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi:_Death_Star_Battle) game. This is a de/remake of the game, followed as closely as I could without copyright infringement.

# Pizzaboy

This is my psudo Super Mario clone. You can shoot and jump, any hit from an enemy will kill you. Click [here](https://chand1012.dev/pizzaboy/) to play.
