Hello! My name is Chandler Lofland. I am from Northeast Ohio, from a little town called Randolph about 30 minutes from Akron. I have been into computers since I was about 5 or 6, and I have been programming since I was about 10. I have experience in Python, Golang, C/C++, Lua, Ruby, NodeJS, the HTML5 stack (HTML, JS, CSS), BASIC, and command line scripting (bash and Windows Batch). I have been using Linux since 2014, starting with Ubuntu but later moving on to Arch Linux and Alpine Linux, and I have experience developing custom Linux builds using the Yocto Project. I have some microcontroller development experience, mostly being with Arduino, PlatformIO, and MicroPython. I worked at an internship while in college at Automated Packaging Systems (Now being integrated into Autobag by Sealed Air), developing for their systems using C, NodeJS, Python, also being where I got my first experience with Yocto. Recently I have been dabbling in developing Docker Containers for ease of hosting a few of my web or bot projects.

I have a lot of personal projects, many of which I will never finish. I know that seems irresponsible and not something most people would want, but I see it as a learning experience. Because of my many, many projects I have learned all of those computer languages, and depending on the project's complexity, pretty fluently. Some of my larger projects that I am currently developing include my Discord Bot, [Discord-Quick-Meme](https://github.com/chand1012/Discord-Quick-Meme) which quickly gets accredited memes from Reddit and posts them to your Discord chat, another Discord Bot called [discord-weather-bot](https://github.com/chand1012/discord-weather-bot) that uses OpenWeatherMap and the NOAA Weather API along with a few COVID-19 APIs to get Weather and COVID data for your Discord Channel, and another project that is currently under a NDA. I also have a few non-development projects, such as upgrading my [Ender 3 3D printer](https://chand1012.dev/3dprintingintro/), maintaining a few game servers for my friends, or just improving my skills in my favorite video games, such as Rainbow Six Siege.
