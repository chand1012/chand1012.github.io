Hello! My name is Chandler Lofland and I like computers. This is a blog about random tech things, from gaming to programming. I have been programming since I was 11 and been gaming as long as I can remember. I am currently attending the University of Akron as a Computer Engineering student, work at a Pizza Shop in my town during school, and recently started a software engineering internship.
